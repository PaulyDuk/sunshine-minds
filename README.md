# Introduction

Sunshine Minds is my first individually assessed project developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. This will cover the skills I have covered so far whcih consists of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, with the use of AI to generate code and assist with debugging.

### Project Outline

The purpose of this website is to raise mental health awareness and what a user can do to improve that via various means, such as physical activity, balanced and healthy died and sleep improvment. Although a base of hints and tips will be included here additional resources will be linked for the user to explore further

### Key Objectives:

- A clean and easy to navigate website that is responsive in design.
- Provide mental health information to the user.
- User will receive uplifting quote and inspiration on the index page.
- A calming color palette and image set to entice the user in further and remain on the page.
- Links to external sources to allow the user to reach further information.

# UX/UI Design

### Colour Design

Given the name of Sunshine Minds I initially decided to go for a blue (simulating the sea) and yellow/orange (simulate the sun) colour scheme. However my initially choices were hard to read and when tested with the webaim.org contrast checker were failing to pass. As such the final colours were tweaked from this and now pass the contrast checker fully. I also believe the colours now look much better and still invite a calming response, with blue backgrounds with a yellow text. I also decided to use a white font in the darker blue navigation and footers for a better contrast and to stand out, as well as not overuse the yellow font throughout the scheme.

### Fonts

I decided on two fonts for this project, both sourced from Google Fonts, which was Dancing Script for the headings and Raleway for the body text. I found the Dancing Script font to be playful and simulated cursive handwriting well whereas the body front of Raleway was easily legible for the bulk of the body text. I like the difference between the two and that this helped break up the sections nicely.

### Images

I initially decided to go against using AI for the images as I thought people would be able to relate more to real life images. All images are royalty free from pexels.com and show the situation regarding to the card it is describing. These were later resized and optimised to the web using squoosh.app, A really handy free online tool to do so. I had also initially decided to include logos on the resources page but decided against this, as the colours of the logos did not sit well with my chosen design theme.

The hero image has a gradient applied to allow the text to be legible. My initial thought was to include a suitable hero image on each page but in testing later on this did not suit the site how I had evisaged.

I also decided to add a small image from font-awesome.com for each card for a quick visual respresentation of what the card details would include. I also decided to swap the image between the top of the bottom of the cards to make the site more visually appealing and break up the sections.
